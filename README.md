# Hex-Oust

A Swing-based implementation of a hexagonal board game inspired by "Oust", developed as part of UCD's Software Engineering 2 module.

## 🧩 Project Overview

Hex-Oust is a strategic 2-player board game played on a hexagonal grid. Players take turns placing pieces, aiming to control territory and outmaneuver their opponent.

This project focuses on:
- Java Swing GUI development using `JPanel`
- Interactive hexagonal grid rendering
- Game logic implementation and win condition detection
- Clean software architecture and modular design

## 🚀 Features

- Click-to-place gameplay on a hex grid
- Accurate hex coordinate handling
- Visual feedback on mouse events
- Responsive UI built with Swing components
- Object-oriented code structure

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Swing (JPanel)
- IntelliJ IDE
